# Projects 

## DESIGN LANGUAGE SYSTEM (DLS)
Lead Engineer, technical advocate, and custodian of the web component library utilised across all Singtel consumer-facing products and services. Design System Library (DLS) is built as a React library for web and a React Native library for mobile platforms and serves as the foundational design framework for Singtel's consumer-facing offerings. The DLS team oversees all design and UI/UX practices within the product teams. 
⚒️ I prepare documentation, plan releases and versioning, maintain CICD pipelines, coordinate with these teams to facilitate adoption, conduct training and onboarding sessions, identify challenges, and ensure DLS integration into the product ecosystem.

## IPHONE LAUNCH (2020, 2021)
Lead team of 5 engineers for the mission-critical annual event where customers place pre-orders for 1000s of iPhones at Singtel eShop websites. This ninja team owns the website, infrastructure, and ordering system, as well as the playbook tailored to handle the spike in traffic. This team was the major driver for revenue and remains so to this day. 
⚒️ We built the system with a React frontend with a Spring Boot backend, both hosted on AWS. The system collects the orders and then dispatches them to our legacy order management system.
I coordinated with Singtel eShop and dotcom marketing sites and prepared playbooks to streamline execution and mitigate risks during the event.

## HEADLESS AEM
Led front-end architecture revamp initiative (Headless AEM) for content-heavy microsites, improving performance of the user-facing website while fully leveraging the existing CMS capabilities of the AEM platform. The revamp reduced time-to-deploy from 1 hour to 10 minutes. This enhancement enabled product owners to preview and test updates more quickly before launching marketing and sales campaigns.
⚒️ I conceptualised the project, secured buy-in, and planned its delivery. I designed the system architecture, built the core modules and prepared deployment and integration with AEM systems. 

## DETOX
Contributed to the revamp of Singtel eShop (Detox), reducing load time from a few minutes to a few seconds and reducing build times in CI/CD from 1 hour to 10 minutes. This rewrite of the eShop website integrates the order and inventory systems with Static Site Generation tools (Gatsby) to pre-render product pages, resulting in a 20% increase in website traffic. This whole application is e2e tested with Cypress and deployed on S3 via GitHub Actions.
