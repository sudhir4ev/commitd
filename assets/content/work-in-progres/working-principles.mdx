## Working Across Backend, DevOps, and Product

Effective frontend engineering at scale requires close collaboration across disciplines. I have worked in
cross-functional squads, partnering with Spring Boot backend engineers, AWS DevOps teams, AEM platform teams, and
product owners. The best results come from frontend engineers who understand and communicate effectively with their
collaborators.

With backend teams, I enocourage contract-first API design: agreeing on schema, error shapes, and pagination before a
line of code is written. (Pact, OpenApi) This avoids the all-too-common situation where the frontend is blocked by an
API that doesn't match what the UI actually needs.

In collaboration with DevOps and platform teams, I approach CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as integral products. I
have developed and maintained pipelines using GitHub Actions and Bitbucket Pipelines, managed deployments to AWS S3, and
worked with Nomad-based container orchestration. I have setup VPS with Ansible and Tailscale access. I consider
infrastructure a shared responsibility.

With product and design teams, I act as a translator. I evaluate technical feasibility, challenge designs that introduce
unnecessary complexity, and advocate for design systems as a shared language between design and engineering.

## Leadership Style

My leadership style is servant-technical: I focus on elevating the capabilities of those around me rather than seeking
to be the most knowledgeable person in the room.

In practice:

- I use architecture RFCs and PRD as educational tools. I write RFCs to document decisions, surface underlying
  assumptions, encourage constructive challenge, and foster shared understanding. Effective RFCs clarify tradeoffs and
  promote collective ownership of outcomes.
- I approach code review as an opportunity for mentorship. During pull request reviews, I prioritize asking questions,
  such as "What happens here if the API returns a 429?" This approach encourages critical reasoning rather than simply
  providing answers. One should also be mindful of long PR reviews comments, which can come across as intimidating. If
  there are several issues to address, it might be prudent to have an in-person chat.
- I promote standards through automation. Rules that depend on manual enforcement are prone to inconsistency. Tools such
  as ESLint, Prettier, commit-lint, and Husky hooks automate style and quality enforcement, allowing code reviews to
  focus on design considerations.
- I approach onboarding as a systematic process. I have conducted structured onboarding and training sessions for teams
  adopting shared platforms (DLS). I consider the onboarding experience a product: if a new engineer is not productive
  within the first week, this indicates a failure in documentation or tooling rather than individual capability.
- I prioritize psychological safety in technical decision-making. I actively encourage junior engineers to question
  architectural choices. Many of the most significant improvements have resulted from individuals asking, "why do we do
  it this way?"
